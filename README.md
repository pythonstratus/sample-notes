Now you have the complete DailyLoad.java file with the proper package declaration. To build and test this application using Maven:

1. Create a project directory structure following Maven conventions:
```
daily-load/
├── pom.xml
└── src/
    ├── main/
    │   └── java/
    │       └── com/
    │           └── als/
    │               └── DailyLoad.java
    └── test/
        └── java/
            └── com/
                └── als/
                    └── DailyLoadTest.java
```

2. Place the pom.xml file I provided in the root directory of the project.

3. Place the completed DailyLoad.java file in src/main/java/com/als/.

4. Place the DailyLoadTest.java file in src/test/java/com/als/.

5. Modify the paths in the initialize() method to point to valid directories on your system or create a test environment with the required directory structure.

6. To build the application:
```
mvn clean compile
```

7. To run the tests:
```
mvn test
```

8. To package the application into a JAR file:
```
mvn package
```

Since this application interacts with external systems (Oracle database, file system, Unix commands), you'll need to either:

1. Set up a complete test environment with all dependencies, or
2. Use the test subclass approach that overrides external dependencies with mock implementations.

The test class I provided includes a DailyLoadTestable subclass that overrides the methods that interact with external systems, allowing you to test the application logic without the need for actual database connections or file system access.

To test this `DailyLoad` Java program, you'll need to prepare a proper testing environment since it has several external dependencies. I'll provide you with a step-by-step approach:

## Testing Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
The code requires an Oracle database connection:
- You'll need an Oracle database instance (Oracle XE would work for testing)
- Create an 'als' schema/user with appropriate permissions
- Set up the required tables:
  - LOGLOAD table with columns: LOADNAME, EXTRDT, LOADDT, UNIX, NUMREC
  - Create any other tables referenced in SQL queries
- Set up the DATELIB package with xtrcthdy and nsrtholidayrecs procedures

### 2. File System Setup
Create the directory structure mentioned in the code:
```
- /als-ALS/app (base application directory)
  - /execloc/d.common (contains Decipherit utility)
  - /execloc/d.als (contains ORA.path)
  - /execloc/d.entity (contains als_lock script)
  - /execloc/d.loads (contains load scripts like c.procE5)
- /path/to/log/directory (for log files)
- /path/to/ftp/directory (where extract files arrive)
- /path/to/backup/directory (for backups)
```

### 3. Input Files
Prepare test extract files in the FTP directory:
- Create files named E5, E3, E8, E7, and EB with proper formatting
- Each file should have extract dates at specific positions as defined in the datePositions map
- For E5, date position is 65-72
- For E3, date position is 3-10
- For E8, date position is 28-35
- For E7, date position is 78-85
- For EB, date position is 48-55

### 4. Modify the Code for Testing

1. Update the hardcoded paths in the `initialize()` method:
```java
// Set actual paths for testing
appBase = "/your-test-path/als-ALS/app";
logDir = "/your-test-path/log";
ftpDir = "/your-test-path/ftp";
bkupDir = "/your-test-path/backup";
```

2. Create a test method that bypasses system command execution:
```java
// Add this before the main method
public static void testMode() {
    // Override executeCommand to return test data
    // Override executeSqlQuery to return test data
}
```

3. Modify the database connection details:
```java
// In executeSqlQuery and other DB methods
conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:XE", "als", "your_test_password");
```

## Testing Approach

### 1. Unit Testing Components
Start by testing individual methods:

```java
public class DailyLoadTest {
    // Set up test environment
    private DailyLoad loader;
    
    @Before
    public void setUp() {
        loader = new DailyLoad();
        loader.initialize();
        // Set up mocks/stubs for external dependencies
    }
    
    @Test
    public void testGetYesterdayDate() {
        // Test getting yesterday's date
    }
    
    @Test
    public void testConvertToJulianDate() {
        // Test date conversion
    }
    
    // More test methods...
}
```

### 2. Integration Testing
Set up a controlled environment with:
- Known data in the database
- Sample extract files with controlled dates

### 3. Mock External Commands
For fully automated testing, you'll need to mock the external command execution:

```java
// Override executeCommand for testing
private String executeCommand(String command) {
    // For testing, return predefined responses based on command
    if (command.contains("date +%a")) {
        return "Tue\n"; // Simulate Tuesday
    } else if (command.contains("head -1")) {
        return "SAMPLE DATA WITH DATE 20240228\n"; // Sample extract file content
    }
    // Other command responses...
    return "";
}
```

## Simplified Test Approach

If you want a simpler approach to just see it running:

1. Create a test class that extends DailyLoad and overrides critical methods:

```java
public class DailyLoadTester extends DailyLoad {
    @Override
    protected String executeCommand(String command) {
        System.out.println("Would execute: " + command);
        // Return simulated results
        return simulateCommandResult(command);
    }
    
    private String simulateCommandResult(String command) {
        // Implementation that returns test data based on command
    }
    
    @Override
    protected String executeSqlQuery(String sql) {
        System.out.println("Would execute SQL: " + sql);
        // Return simulated results
        return simulateSqlResult(sql);
    }
    
    private String simulateSqlResult(String sql) {
        // Implementation that returns test data based on SQL query
    }
    
    // Main method for testing
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            DailyLoadTester tester = new DailyLoadTester();
            tester.initialize();
            tester.processDailyLoad(args);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

## Important Considerations

1. **Database Requirements**: You must have an Oracle database with the correct schema setup.

2. **Path Modifications**: All file paths need to be updated to match your testing environment.

3. **External Scripts**: The code calls several external shell scripts and utilities:
   - als_lock
   - c.procE5, c.procE3, etc.
   - Oracle configuration scripts

4. **Security Implications**: The code handles passwords - for testing, use a safe environment.

5. **Operating System Requirements**: The code makes heavy use of Unix commands, so testing on a Unix-like system is recommended.

For a complete test, you'd need to set up all these components. For a quick test, you could create mock implementations of the external dependencies to verify the flow of the application.
