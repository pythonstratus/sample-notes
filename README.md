Now you have the complete DailyLoad.java file with the proper package declaration. To build and test this application using Maven:

1. Create a project directory structure following Maven conventions:
```
daily-load/
├── pom.xml
└── src/
    ├── main/
    │   └── java/
    │       └── com/
    │           └── als/
    │               └── DailyLoad.java
    └── test/
        └── java/
            └── com/
                └── als/
                    └── DailyLoadTest.java
```

2. Place the pom.xml file I provided in the root directory of the project.

3. Place the completed DailyLoad.java file in src/main/java/com/als/.

4. Place the DailyLoadTest.java file in src/test/java/com/als/.

5. Modify the paths in the initialize() method to point to valid directories on your system or create a test environment with the required directory structure.

6. To build the application:
```
mvn clean compile
```

7. To run the tests:
```
mvn test
```

8. To package the application into a JAR file:
```
mvn package
```

Since this application interacts with external systems (Oracle database, file system, Unix commands), you'll need to either:

1. Set up a complete test environment with all dependencies, or
2. Use the test subclass approach that overrides external dependencies with mock implementations.

The test class I provided includes a DailyLoadTestable subclass that overrides the methods that interact with external systems, allowing you to test the application logic without the need for actual database connections or file system access.
