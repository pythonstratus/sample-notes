# PPAS 15 Cluster Testing Status

## Completed Validations
- Schema comparison between legacy and new environments
- Function validation across environments

## Current Blocker
GoCD pipeline testing is blocked due to missing server variables in new environment.

## Required Actions
1. Identify all required server variables from existing GoCD pipelines
2. Request variable configuration for new servers through appropriate channels
3. Validate variable implementation before proceeding with pipeline testing

## Next Steps
1. Document all missing server variables
2. Submit configuration request for new environment
3. Verify variable implementation
4. Proceed with GoCD pipeline validation once variables are configured

## Dependencies
- Server team availability for variable configuration
- Access permissions for new environment
- Variable validation process completion

## Risk Mitigation
Consider creating a temporary test environment with mock variables if server team availability becomes a bottleneck.
