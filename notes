I see another field error for "ns1:isMinorityOwned". Let's fix this field and keep the row count code. Here's how we should modify the relevant parts:

```python
# First fix the minority owned field in the selection
# In the processed_df definition, change this line:
col("ns0:content.ns1:award.ns1:vendor.ns1:vendorSiteDetails.ns1:vendorSocioEconomicIndicators.ns1:minorityOwned.ns1:isMinorityOwned").alias("is_minority_owned"),

# ... then add the row count after the cleaning
# Get row and column counts
num_rows = cleaned_df.count()
num_cols = len(cleaned_df.columns)
print(f"Number of rows: {num_rows}")
print(f"Number of columns: {num_cols}")

# Display first 100 rows
display(cleaned_df.head(100))
```

The key change is in the path to the minority owned field - we need to use `minorityOwned` instead of `isMinorityOwned` in the path. This should resolve the field error you're seeing.

Would you like me to show the complete updated code with this fix?
