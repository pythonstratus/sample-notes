Hi Team,
I've prepared a documentation template for our upcoming database cleanup initiative in the BK_MPO staging environment. This cleanup aims to optimize our storage usage and improve environment maintenance.
The document covers:

Schemas and tables proposed for removal
Test data cleanup plans
Impact analysis
Backup and rollback procedures
Verification steps

Could you please review the attached template and provide feedback by [Date]? We'll incorporate your comments before proceeding with the final cleanup plan.
The template is designed to ensure we have proper documentation and approvals in place before any modifications.
