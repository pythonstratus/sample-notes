This difference wasn't explicitly requested but rather represents a natural architectural transformation during the migration to Databricks. The change from file_id to file_path reflects a shift from a normalized relational database structure to a denormalized data lake structure, which is more appropriate for the Databricks environment. The direct inclusion of file_path in the HELOC table eliminates the need for joins and simplifies data access patterns.
