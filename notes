```
Primary Key Implementation - Staging Silver Tables

Status: Ready for Testing and Production Implementation

Summary:
- Successfully implemented primary key constraints for 6 staging silver tables based on Henry's analysis spreadsheet
- All tables were validated for:
  * Duplicate records
  * NULL values in key columns
  * Data integrity constraints

Tables Implemented:
1. staging.bk_mpo.loan
2. staging.bk_mpo.loan_arm
3. staging.bk_mpo.loan_current
4. staging.bk_mpo.loan_delinquency_history
5. staging.bk_mpo.loan_lookup
6. staging.bk_mpo.mc_dash_actual_counts

Implementation Details:
- Full implementation script available at: [Insert GitHub Link]
- Each table underwent NOT NULL constraints enforcement
- Composite primary keys were created based on business requirements
- All validation queries are documented in the script

Next Steps:
1. QA Testing in Staging environment
2. Production deployment approval
3. Implementation in Production environment

Note: The implementation follows Databricks best practices for constraint management and data integrity.

# Database Primary Key Implementation

This document outlines the process of validating and implementing primary keys for tables migrated from PostgreSQL to Databricks.

## Loan Table

The following steps were taken to implement a composite primary key (loan_id, file_path) for the loan table:

[Previous loan table implementation remains the same]

## Loan Arm Table

### 1. Validate Uniqueness
```sql
SELECT file_path, loan_id, COUNT(*)
FROM staging.bk_mpo.loan_arm
GROUP BY file_path, loan_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

### 2. Check for NULL Values
```sql
SELECT file_path, loan_id
FROM staging.bk_mpo.loan_arm
WHERE file_path IS NULL;
```

### 3. Make Columns NOT NULL
```sql
ALTER TABLE staging.bk_mpo.loan_arm ALTER COLUMN file_path SET NOT NULL;
```

### 4. Create Primary Key Constraint
```sql
ALTER TABLE staging.bk_mpo.loan_arm
ADD CONSTRAINT loan_arm_id_file_path PRIMARY KEY (loan_id, file_path);
```

## Loan Current Table

### 1. Validate Uniqueness
```sql
SELECT file_path, loan_id, COUNT(*)
FROM staging.bk_mpo.loan_current
GROUP BY file_path, loan_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

### 2. Check for NULL Values
```sql
SELECT file_path, loan_id
FROM staging.bk_mpo.loan_current
WHERE file_path IS NULL;
```

### 3. Make Columns NOT NULL
```sql
ALTER TABLE staging.bk_mpo.loan_current ALTER COLUMN file_path SET NOT NULL;
```

### 4. Create Primary Key Constraint
```sql
ALTER TABLE staging.bk_mpo.loan_current
ADD CONSTRAINT loan_current_id_file_path PRIMARY KEY (loan_id, file_path);
```

## Loan Delinquency History Table

### 1. Validate Uniqueness
```sql
SELECT file_path, loan_id, COUNT(*)
FROM staging.bk_mpo.loan_delinquency_history
GROUP BY file_path, loan_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

### 2. Check for NULL Values
```sql
SELECT file_path, loan_id
FROM staging.bk_mpo.loan_delinquency_history
WHERE file_path IS NULL;
```

### 3. Make Columns NOT NULL
```sql
ALTER TABLE staging.bk_mpo.loan_delinquency_history ALTER COLUMN file_path SET NOT NULL;
```

### 4. Create Primary Key Constraint
```sql
ALTER TABLE staging.bk_mpo.loan_delinquency_history
ADD CONSTRAINT loan_delinquency_history_id_file_path PRIMARY KEY (loan_id, file_path);
```

## Loan Lookup Table

### 1. Validate Uniqueness
```sql
SELECT file_path, typecode, type, COUNT(*)
FROM staging.bk_mpo.loan_lookup
GROUP BY file_path, typecode, type
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

### 2. Check for NULL Values
```sql
SELECT file_path, typecode, type
FROM staging.bk_mpo.loan_lookup
WHERE file_path IS NULL
   OR typecode IS NULL
   OR type IS NULL;
```

### 3. Make Columns NOT NULL
```sql
ALTER TABLE staging.bk_mpo.loan_lookup ALTER COLUMN file_path SET NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE staging.bk_mpo.loan_lookup ALTER COLUMN typecode SET NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE staging.bk_mpo.loan_lookup ALTER COLUMN type SET NOT NULL;
```

### 4. Create Primary Key Constraint
```sql
ALTER TABLE staging.bk_mpo.loan_lookup
ADD CONSTRAINT loan_lookup_history_id_file_path_type PRIMARY KEY (file_path, typecode, type);
```

## MC Dash Actual Counts Table

### 1. Validate Uniqueness
```sql
SELECT file_path, file_name, COUNT(*)
FROM staging.bk_mpo.mc_dash_actual_counts
GROUP BY file_path, file_name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

### 2. Check for NULL Values
```sql
SELECT file_path, file_name
FROM staging.bk_mpo.mc_dash_actual_counts
WHERE file_path IS NULL
   OR file_name IS NULL;
```

### 3. Make Columns NOT NULL
```sql
ALTER TABLE staging.bk_mpo.mc_dash_actual_counts ALTER COLUMN file_path SET NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE staging.bk_mpo.mc_dash_actual_counts ALTER COLUMN file_name SET NOT NULL;
```

### 4. Create Primary Key Constraint
```sql
ALTER TABLE staging.bk_mpo.mc_dash_actual_counts
ADD CONSTRAINT mc_dash_actual_counts_file_path_name PRIMARY KEY (file_name, file_path);
```

**Note**: When implementing primary keys in Databricks:
- Constraints are enforced during write operations
- Consider using OPTIMIZE with ZORDER BY on primary key columns for better performance
- Ensure all constituent columns of the primary key are NOT NULL
