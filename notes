Title: Enhance Error Handling for Silver Table Pipeline Notebooks

Description:
Currently, when a silver table operation fails in one of the pipeline notebooks, the error handling could be improved to provide better visibility and debugging capabilities. This ticket proposes implementing a more robust error handling mechanism.

Proposed Changes:
1. Modify individual notebooks (HELOC_MASTER_APPEND_OPERATION, LOAN_MONTH_LOSS_MIT_MASTER_APPEND_OPERATION, LOAN_MONTH_MASTER_APPEND_OPERATION) to properly raise and propagate exceptions instead of just exiting with "FAILED" status
2. Update the orchestration notebook to:
   - Implement try/catch blocks for each notebook execution
   - Re-raise exceptions from individual notebooks with contextual information
   - Stop the entire pipeline when a critical error occurs
   - Provide clear error messages indicating which specific silver table operation failed

Expected Benefits:
- Improved error visibility and traceability
- Easier investigation of pipeline failures
- More efficient debugging process
- Clear indication of which specific step in the pipeline failed

Technical Implementation:
- Replace current dbutils.notebook.exit("FAILED") pattern with proper exception handling
- Implement structured error logging
- Propagate detailed error information from child notebooks to the main orchestration notebook
- Ensure pipeline stops immediately when a critical error occurs in any silver table operation

Current Behavior:
Individual notebooks exit with "FAILED" status without propagating the actual error details to the orchestration level.

Desired Behavior:
Pipeline should properly propagate and handle exceptions, making it immediately obvious which silver table operation failed and why.
