# FPDS Data Processing Workflow

## Overview
This workflow processes Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) data through multiple stages of transformation and validation. The pipeline is designed to handle procurement data while maintaining version history and transaction records.

## Workflow Components

### Task Settings
- Task Name: `task_settings`
- Purpose: Configures and initializes job parameters
- Dependencies: None (Start node)

### FPDS Scraper
- Task Name: `fpds_scrapper`
- Purpose: Extracts raw procurement data from FPDS system
- Dependencies: Requires task_settings completion
- Output: Raw procurement data

### Bronze Layer
- Task Name: `bronze`
- Purpose: Initial data landing zone
- Dependencies: Requires fpds_scrapper completion
- Processing: Minimal transformation, maintains raw data integrity
- Output: Bronze-level data store

### FPDS Silver Ingest
- Task Name: `fpds_silver_ingest`
- Purpose: Refines and cleanses bronze data
- Dependencies: Requires bronze layer completion
- Processing: Data validation, standardization, and quality checks
- Output: Silver-level refined dataset

### Additional Components

#### File Version History
- Component: `file_version_history`
- Purpose: Maintains historical versions of processed files
- Tracking: Version metadata, change history

#### Transaction History
- Component: `transaction_history`
- Purpose: Records all data transformations
- Tracking: Operation logs, data lineage

## Workflow Architecture
The workflow follows a medallion architecture:
1. Raw data ingestion via FPDS scraper
2. Bronze layer for raw storage
3. Silver layer for refined data
4. Supporting components for version control and transaction logging

## Best Practices
- Monitor task completion status
- Review logs in transaction_history for data lineage
- Verify file versions in file_version_history
- Ensure proper task dependencies are maintained

## Error Handling
- Each task includes error logging
- Failed tasks trigger alerts
- Transaction history maintains error states
- Version control allows for data recovery

## Maintenance
- Regular monitoring of task execution times
- Periodic review of data quality metrics
- Version history cleanup as needed
- Transaction log maintenance
