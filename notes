I'll explain how the confidence (PK) score is calculated in the script. The score ranges from 0 to 1 (or 0-100%), where higher scores indicate better PK candidates. Here's how the scoring breaks down:

1. Uniqueness (40% of score):
   - If column has a unique constraint: +0.4 
   - This is the most important factor since PKs must be unique

2. NOT NULL constraint (20% of score):
   - If column has NOT NULL constraint: +0.2
   - Second most important since PKs shouldn't allow nulls

3. Appropriate Data Type (10% of score):
   - If column is INTEGER, BIGINT, or UUID: +0.1
   - These types are optimal for PKs

4. Null Fraction (10% of score):
   - If column has zero nulls: +0.1
   - Checks actual data, not just constraints

5. Distinct Value Ratio (10% of score):
   - If >99% of values are unique: +0.1
   - Validates uniqueness in actual data

6. Existing Constraints (10% of score):
   - If column has other constraints: +0.1
   - Indicates column's importance

The script considers columns scoring above 0.7 (70%) as good PK candidates. So for example:
- A unique, NOT NULL, integer column would score 0.7 (0.4 + 0.2 + 0.1)
- A unique column with nulls would only score 0.4
- A perfect candidate would score 1.0

Would you like me to add this explanation to the report output to make the scores more meaningful to users?
