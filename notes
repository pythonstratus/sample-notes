The as_of_month values (485, 486, etc.) in the loan_month table represent a business-specific or legacy date encoding format that was maintained during the migration to Databricks to ensure consistency with existing processes and data integrity. This format predates the migration and wasn't changed since it's consistently used in both PostgreSQL and Databricks environments. The difference in format compared to other tables is not related to the file_path availability but rather reflects a historical or business-specific way of tracking loan months that the system continues to use.
